This is sort of inspired by spotify's The Car Thing, hence the name. 

while i am famailiar with my 3d modeling software, onshape, and i have been 3d printing for the past couple of months since i got my printer, this is my first project that invovles electronics. 
This project was the first time i've ever used Kicad, and throuhg follwing guides and tutorials on youtube, i was able to cobble together my own little macropad!
